>>I just wanted to add the results, which are not expected, after I test the program


1. After I destroy the database, if I want to create it again without exitting the program, it just says "Error creating file" and exits.

2. When I tried to exit from program with 100k without destroying database, it gives a segmentation fault, but not with 1k data.

3. if the lower bound is greater than upper bound, program still works for the range search. (I believe that it is not necessary, but it's logical mistake)

4. I don't get it why but when I was destroying the database right after I populated it, there is no problem. However, after I populated database I did 3/4 key search, data search as well as range search. Then, I tried to destroy database and I got segmentation fault. (For Btree)
